                        <h6>
                            Micro Front End Architecture is a simply dividing a monolithic application into a smaller modules.
                        </h6>

                        <h6>
                            Smaller modules means every module will have a separate code base and separate git repo
                        </h6>

                        <h5>Let's first understand what is the meaning of Monolithic Architecture ?</h5>
                        <h6>
                            Monolithic Architecture means everything is written in one place, I mean end to end code base is kept at place, and whole application is running from one code repo so You can say this is the monolithic architecture.
                        </h6>

                        <h6 className="text-danger"> What is the disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture ? </h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                I would say by keeping everything is one place it can take more time to build the project why because while building activity - all code base will go through the building process.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                If any set of component or any internal modules is getting failed somehow so it may be a chance your application performances can be impact. Because end to end code is written in single chain.
                            </li>

                            <li>Bundle size of the application will also impact</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>So this was the few disadvantages for Monolithic Architecture.</h6>

                        <hr />

                        <h5>Now let's focus on the Micro Front End Architecture</h5>
                        <h6>
                            So first of all - Micro Front End Architecture is not any technologies it is just a concept or you can say that this is way to handle the large application. If you have a huge traffic on your application or let's suppose you have many features so here what you can do - you can keep expensive features in a separate code base, and you can import those fearures in your main code repo
                        </h6>

                        <h6>Let's try to understand by an example: So in any e-commerce application where you can see multiple features modules are present like - Product Listing, Full Details about the Product, Cart module, Navigations, Sliders, Carousels etc.</h6>

                        <h6>So for handling this type of scenario you can go with Micro Front End Architecture and regarding this what you need to do ? you need to establish the different different code base with git repo, where each repo will handle a single responsibilities.</h6>

                        <h6>And trust me by using this approach your application performace will increase.</h6>

                        <hr className="bg-warning" />

                        <h5>Finally Let's talk about the Benefits of Micro-Frontends:</h5>

                        <h6>
                            <b>1. Independent Development:</b> Different teams can work on different parts of the application simultaneously without interfering with each other.
                        </h6>

                        <h6>
                            <b>2. Easy Deployment and building:</b> Deployment is easy
                        </h6>

                        <h6>
                            <b>3. Scalability:</b> Different parts of the frontend can be scaled independently based on need.
                        </h6>

                        <h6>
                            <b>4. Improved Maintainability:</b> Smaller, well-defined codebases are easier to maintain and understand.
                        </h6>

                        <h6>
                            <b>5. Faster Releases:</b> Independent deployment means that changes in one part of the application can be released without requiring a full deployment of the entire frontend.
                        </h6>

                                Yes - you can absolutely use different technologies like React, Angular, and Next.js together in a Micro Frontend architecture. In fact, this is one of the core advantages of Micro Frontends.
